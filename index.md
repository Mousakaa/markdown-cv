## Hobbies

I play jazz piano and I love music (I was in a rock band called [Crimson Lily](https://youtu.be/kEpob4iMEhI) for some time).

I practiced hip-hop for ten-ish years with [Harmonie Danse](https://harmonie-danse-44.com/) (see me [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVe8Q2kfiiA)).

I also like tinkering with electronic stuff and seeing what comes out, and I code during my personal time. I have used Arduino for a long time and Raspberry lately for those projects.
